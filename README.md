# Flappy Bird in Assembly Language

This project classic Flappy Bird game, developed using x86 assembly language and designed to run on a 25x80 text-mode display.

## Features
- **Smooth gameplay**: Fly the bird through moving pillars.
- **Scrolling ground**: Realistic movement for an immersive experience.
- **Assembly magic**: Built entirely with x86 assembly in real mode.
- **Text-mode graphics**: Creative use of the 25x80 screen for retro visuals.

## How It Works
- **Game Loop**: The game continuously updates the birdâ€™s position, moves the pillars, and scrolls the ground.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects when the bird hits a pillar or the ground.
- **Score Keeping**: Tracks your progress as you navigate through the obstacles.
- **Text Display**: Uses text-mode video memory to draw the game.

### Requirements
- An x86 emulator (e.g., DOSBox, QEMU) or a real x86 system.
- A basic understanding of assembly language (optional, but helpful).
